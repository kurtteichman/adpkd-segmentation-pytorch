## Inference Data

#### Running `adpkd_segmentation/inference/inference.py` will perform inference on `inference_input` files

Input dicom files should be kept in this directory (`adpkd-segmentation/inference_input`)

Additional Notes:
* Inference output files at `adpkd-segmentation/saved_inference`
* Figure output files at `adpkd-segmentation/saved_figs`
